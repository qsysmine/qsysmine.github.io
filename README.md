This is my personal website. Nothing more, nothing less. Except I don't have any dev stuff yet. Whoops.

## LIBRARIES
Feel free to burn me at the stake, but I admit it, I use [jQuery](http://jquery.com). Not just that, I also use the wonderful [jQuery.Transit](http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/) for CSS3 animations through Javascript.

## FONTS
+ [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/selection?selection.family=Libre+Baskerville:400,400i,700)

## SECRETS &amp; EASTER EGGS
N/A
